## Features

This is sample project showing how to add new file templates to template manager from VZ File Templates extension using another Visual Studio Code extension. Template manager allows to specify user template folders so you could copy your templates manually there, but it is much easier to redistribute and update them with another VS Code extension. 

## Registering new templates

It is very easy to register new templates. All you have to do is to create a folder with them in your extension and then register that folder in template manager inside your extension activation function.

## Requirements

VZ File Template extension must be installed
